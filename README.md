1. Feynman Writing Prompts - Write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.
		
	* Variables: variables are containers that are assigned values. These values can be a variety of datatypes.
	* Strings: strings are one of the datatypes - strings are pretty much anything in between ‘single’ or “double quotes”.
	* Functions (arguments, `return`): functions are like variables, but they are blocks of code. Even conditions can be passed through functions. It’s skipped until the function is called, only then will the computer look at the code inside and execute it.
	* `if` statements: if statements are blocks of code that are executed only if something is true. If it’s not true, most of the time else is used as well. When if else statements become too long, switch statements are used instead.
	* Boolean values (`true`, `false`): * booleans are also datatypes, you write them without quotes and they should be non-capital. These are always answering yes or no questions, or in other words true or false.
